## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "Corrupted zip: can't find end of central directory"
- **Solution**: You're using the original ZIP from ChatGPT. Follow the preparation steps to create a new ZIP file.

**Problem**: Images show as "[File: -Deleted-]"
- **Solution**: Ensure you've properly prepared the ZIP file. The app includes multiple fallback methods to locate images.

**Problem**: Browser becomes unresponsive with large files
- **Solution**: Be patient during processing. The app handles large files (tested up to 500MB) with progress tracking.
