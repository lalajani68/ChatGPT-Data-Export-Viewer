## üîí Why This Tool Exists

In recent months, growing concerns have emerged about the privacy and security of ChatGPT conversations. Reports surfaced that private ChatGPT conversations were being indexed by Google search engines, potentially exposing sensitive personal information to the public ([Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/chatgpt-kills-google-indexable-chats-459874), [Dev.to](https://dev.to/alifar/exposed-google-is-indexing-private-ai-conversations-heres-what-you-should-know-37m5)). This revelation highlighted a critical vulnerability in how our AI conversations are stored and protected.

Adding to these concerns, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has explicitly warned that ChatGPT conversations lack legal confidentiality protections, stating that conversations could potentially be used in court unlike communications with lawyers or therapists ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/sam-altman-warns-theres-no-legal-confidentiality-when-using-chatgpt-as-a-therapist/), [Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/07/46744816/sam-altman-warns-chatgpt-conversations-arent-protected-like-talking-with-your-psychologist-or-lawyer-we-could-be-required-to-produce-that-in-court)).

I created this tool to empower users to take control of their ChatGPT data. By providing a secure, offline method to view and manage conversation exports, this application enables you to:
- Safely archive your conversations without relying on cloud storage
- Review your chat history in a user-friendly interface
- Make informed decisions about which conversations to keep or delete
- Maintain your privacy while preserving access to your valuable AI interactions

Once you've exported and reviewed your conversations using this tool, you can confidently delete sensitive data from ChatGPT's servers, knowing you've maintained a local copy of what's important to you.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "Corrupted zip: can't find end of central directory"
- **Solution**: You're using the original ZIP from ChatGPT. Follow the preparation steps to create a new ZIP file.

**Problem**: Images show as "[File: -Deleted-]"
- **Solution**: Ensure you've properly prepared the ZIP file. The app includes multiple fallback methods to locate images.

**Problem**: Browser becomes unresponsive with large files
- **Solution**: Be patient during processing. The app handles large files (tested up to 500MB) with progress tracking.
